   //TODO - Segmentation faults in C or C++ is an error that occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location it does not have permission to access. Generally, this error occurs when memory access is violated and is a type of general protection fault. Segfaults are the abbreviation for segmentation faults.

    //REVIEW - char ch[6] = "abcdef";: This approach allocates an array and copies the string into it. The array is modifiable and safe for typical string operations.
    //REVIEW -  *c = "abcdef";: This approach sets a pointer to a read-only string literal. Modifying the string via the pointer is unsafe and leads to undefined behavior.
